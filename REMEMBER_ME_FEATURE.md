# Remember Me Feature Implementation

## Overview
The "Remember Me" feature has been successfully added to the GunsmithLocal sign-in page. This feature enhances user experience by allowing users to stay logged in for extended periods and pre-filling their email on subsequent visits.

## Features Implemented

### 1. UI Components
- **Checkbox**: Added a styled "Remember Me" checkbox to the login form
- **Layout**: Positioned between password field and sign-in button
- **Styling**: Custom checkbox styling matching the GunsmithLocal theme (gold accent)

### 2. Functionality
- **Email Pre-fill**: When "Remember Me" is checked, the user's email is saved and pre-filled on next visit
- **Checkbox State**: The checkbox state is preserved between visits
- **Local Storage**: Uses browser's localStorage to store preferences
- **Session Persistence**: Supabase already handles persistent sessions via `persistSession: true`

### 3. Implementation Details

#### Modified Files:
1. **`/src/app/auth/login/page.tsx`**
   - Added `rememberMe` state
   - Added checkbox UI component
   - Implemented localStorage check on mount
   - Updated form submission to pass remember me preference

2. **`/src/lib/auth.ts`**
   - Updated `signIn` function to accept `rememberMe` parameter
   - Stores email and preference in localStorage when checked
   - Clears stored data when unchecked

3. **`/src/app/globals.css`**
   - Added custom checkbox styling
   - Matches GunsmithLocal gold theme
   - Includes hover and focus states

## How It Works

### On Sign In:
1. User checks "Remember Me" checkbox
2. On successful login:
   - Email is stored in `localStorage.rememberedEmail`
   - Preference is stored in `localStorage.rememberMe`
3. Supabase maintains the session with `persistSession: true`

### On Return Visit:
1. Login page checks localStorage
2. If "Remember Me" was previously selected:
   - Email field is pre-filled
   - Checkbox is pre-checked
3. User only needs to enter password

### Security Considerations:
- Only the email is stored (never passwords)
- Uses secure Supabase session management
- localStorage is cleared if user unchecks "Remember Me"
- Sessions still expire based on Supabase settings

## User Experience Benefits:
- ✅ Faster login process for returning users
- ✅ Reduces typing on mobile devices
- ✅ Maintains security while improving convenience
- ✅ Clear visual feedback with styled checkbox
- ✅ Respects user preference when unchecked
