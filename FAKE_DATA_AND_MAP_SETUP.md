# Fake Data and Map Markers Setup

## 100 Fake Gunsmiths Created ‚úÖ

I've created a comprehensive SQL script (`SUPABASE_FAKE_DATA.sql`) with 100 realistic gunsmith businesses across all 50 US states. Each business includes:

### Business Information:
- **Unique business names** themed to their state (e.g., "Lone Star Gunworks" in Texas)
- **Realistic addresses** with actual city/state coordinates
- **Phone numbers** with appropriate area codes
- **Categories**: General Gunsmith, Custom Builder, Cerakote Services, Competition Gunsmith, etc.
- **Specializations**: Each has unique tags and services
- **Descriptions**: Both short and long descriptions highlighting their expertise
- **Business hours**: Realistic operating hours for each shop
- **Year established**: Ranging from 1993 to 2019

### Geographic Distribution:
- 2 gunsmiths per state for even coverage
- Accurate latitude/longitude coordinates for map display
- Major cities and some smaller towns represented

### To Load the Test Data:
1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `SUPABASE_FAKE_DATA.sql`
3. Run the query
4. You'll have 100 test gunsmiths ready to display!

## Map Markers Enhanced ‚úÖ

The map now displays custom markers for each gunsmith location:

### Custom Marker Design:
- **Gunsmith markers**: Gold pin with black center and gold target icon
- **User location**: Blue circle with pulsing effect
- **Hover effects**: Markers are clickable with popup information

### Marker Popups Include:
- Business name (in gold Bebas Neue font)
- Short description
- Full address with pin emoji üìç
- Phone number with phone emoji üìû
- Category with tag emoji üè∑Ô∏è
- "View Details" button

### Map Features:
- **Auto-centering**: Map centers on user location or average of all listings
- **Smart zoom**: Adjusts based on number of listings displayed
- **Filtering**: Markers update based on search and filter criteria
- **Performance**: Only loads listings with valid coordinates

### Technical Implementation:
- Custom SVG icons embedded as data URIs
- Leaflet icon configuration with proper anchor points
- Dynamic icon loading to prevent SSR issues
- Fallback to default markers if custom icons fail

## Testing the Map:
1. Navigate to `/map` or click "Map" in the header
2. Allow location access to see your position
3. Zoom in/out to see gunsmith clusters
4. Click markers to see business details
5. Use filters to narrow down results by state or category

The combination of realistic test data and enhanced map markers creates a professional, functional directory that showcases the platform's capabilities!
