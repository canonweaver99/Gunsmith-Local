# GunsmithLocal Security Features

## Business Listing Security

### 1. Authentication Required
- Users must be logged in to access the "Add Business" page
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to login with a return URL
- "Add Business" link only appears in navigation when logged in

### 2. Email Verification Required
- Users must verify their email address before listing a business
- Verification check happens when accessing `/add-business`
- Clear UI messaging with option to resend verification email
- Prevents spam listings and ensures valid contact information

### 3. Ownership Validation
- Users can only edit/delete their own business listings
- Edit page checks `owner_id` against current user
- Dashboard only shows listings owned by the logged-in user
- Delete operations include ownership verification

## Implementation Details

   - Shows verification UI for unverified users

2. **`/src/components/Header.tsx`**
   - Conditionally renders "Add Business" link
   - Only visible to authenticated users

3. **`/src/app/dashboard/listings/[id]/edit/page.tsx`**

   - Redirects unauthorized users

4. **`/src/app/auth/login/page.tsx`**

### User Flow:
1. **Adding a Business:**
   - Click "Add Business" (only visible when logged in)
   - If not logged in → Redirect to login with return URL
   - If not email verified → Show verification required screen
   - If verified → Access add business form

2. **Editing a Business:**
   - Access from dashboard (only shows user's listings)
   - Edit page verifies ownership
   - Non-owners redirected to dashboard

3. **Security Benefits:**

- `owner_id` field links listings to users
- Only authenticated users can create listings
- Edit/delete operations require ownership match

## Next Steps:
1. Consider adding business verification process
2. Implement admin review for new listings
