## Changes Made to Add Business Form

### 1. Clickable Service Tags
- Replaced the text input field for services with clickable tag buttons
- Added 30 common gunsmith services including:
  - General Repairs
  - Cleaning & Maintenance
  - Sight Installation
  - Trigger Work
  - Barrel Threading
  - Action Tuning
  - Stock Work
  - Cerakote
  - Bluing
  - Custom Builds
  - AR-15 Assembly

### 2. Interactive Tag Selection
- Click tags to select/deselect services
- Selected tags appear with gold background
- Selected services shown in a summary box below
- Each selected tag has an X button to remove it
- Tags automatically update the form data

### 3. URL Slug Removal
- Removed the URL slug field from the UI
- Slug is still automatically generated from business name
- Slug is saved to database for URL routing
- Users don't need to worry about URL formatting

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- Users had to type services manually
- Risk of typos and inconsistent naming
- Users had to understand URL slug concept
- Time-consuming manual entry

### After:
- One-click service selection
- Consistent service naming across listings
- Cleaner, simpler form
- Faster listing creation
- Better data consistency for search/filtering

## Technical Implementation

### Code Changes:
1. Added `selectedTags` state to track selected services
2. Created `commonServices` array with 30 professional services
3. Added `toggleTag` function for tag selection
4. Updated form layout to remove slug field
5. Added visual feedback for selected/unselected tags
6. Tags are converted to comma-separated string for database storage

### Visual Design:
- Unselected tags: Dark background with border
- Selected tags: Gold background with black text
- Hover effects for better interactivity
- Responsive layout that works on mobile
- Clear visual hierarchy

## Next Steps:
- Update the edit business page with the same tag functionality
- Consider adding custom tag input for services not in the list
- Add tag-based filtering to the search functionality
